Our makefile uses a variable called PREFIX to set up the installation path.
The default value is /usr/local. See the examples below...

Quick example temporary installation:

make
make PREFIX=/tmp install
/tmp/flexmem <program> [arguments]


Or, into the default location of /usr/local/:

make
make install
flexmem <program>
