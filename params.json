{"name":"flexmem","tagline":"move any application out-of-core","body":"flexmem allows users to transparently create out-of-core data structures that may be much larger than available RAM\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nflexmem is a general, transparent tool for out-of-core (OOC) computing. It is launched as a command line utility, taking an application as an  argument. All memory allocations larger than a specified threshold are memory-mapped to a binary file. When data are not needed, they are stored on disk. It is both process- and thread-safe.\r\n\r\nflexmem will not make programs run faster. Allocations larger then the specified threshold are allocated onto the disk and retrieval from a disk is slower than for RAM. However, flexmem will allow you to run programs that would not run on a machine due to RAM constraints.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\n1. Linux\r\n2. Some version of openmp is installed on the machine.\r\n3. A C compiler\r\n\r\n# Installing flexmem\r\n\r\nThe flexmem package can be installed by navigating to the \r\n`flexmem/standalone/src` directory using the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmike@mike-VirtualBox:~/Projects/flexmem/standalone/src\r\n> make all\r\nmike@mike-VirtualBox:~/Projects/flexmem/standalone/src\r\n> sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that make install will put the executable into /usr/local/bin and the required shared object file into /usr/local/lib.\r\n\r\n# Installing the R flexmem package\r\n\r\nAfter installing xmem the R xmem package can be installed by navigating\r\nto the `flexmem/Rpkg` directory and using the following commands in a shell:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nR CMD INSTALL flexmem\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe package documentation provides more information about how to use the \r\nR flexmem package.\r\n\r\n# Using xmem\r\n\r\nStart an application in xmem by specifying the application as an argument\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmike@mike-VirtualBox:~/$ xmem R\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe memory-mapped files are stored in `/tmp` by default. This parameter along\r\nwith others can be interrogated using the Rxmem package, included in\r\nthis project.\r\n\r\n# Benchmarks\r\n\r\nIn general flexmem is faster than swap when large chunks of contiguous memory is allocated. When a program makes many, small allocations, then swap is faster. You will get the best performance with flexmem when swap is left on.\r\n\r\nA performance comparison of flexmem vs. page swapping can be found [here](http://slashdot.org).\r\n\r\nA more applied set of benchmarks, which uses flexmem to analyze genetic data, can be found [here](https://github.com/bwlewis/1000_genomes_examples/blob/master/exm.Rmd)\r\n\r\n# Support\r\n\r\n1. flexmem is supported on Linux.\r\n2.
